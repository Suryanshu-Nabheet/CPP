- Know common macros and shortcuts

### 2. Time Complexity Awareness

- Know Big-O notation
- Understand when to use which algorithm
- Optimize based on constraints

### 3. Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand constraints and requirements
2. **Think About Approach**: Choose the right data structure/algorithm
3. **Code Efficiently**: Write clean, readable code
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Check boundary conditions
5. **Optimize**: Reduce time and space complexity if needed

### 4. Common Patterns to Master

- Two Sum / Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search on Answer
- Prefix Sum
- Kadane's Algorithm
- DFS/BFS
- Dynamic Programming

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice!

## Compilation and Running

### Compile a C++ file:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o program filename.cpp
```

### Run:

```bash
./program
```

### For competitive programming:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o program filename.cpp && ./program
```

## Coding Conventions

- Use `long long` instead of `int` when numbers can exceed 10^9
- Use `vector` instead of arrays when size is variable
- Use fast I/O for large inputs
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Handle edge cases (empty inputs, single element, etc.)

### Problem Types in ZCO:

1. Implementation problems
2. Ad-hoc/Greedy
3. Dynamic Programming
