## 🔧 Compilation and Running

### Compile a C++ file:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o program filename.cpp
```

### Run:
```bash
./program
```

### For competitive programming:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o program filename.cpp && ./program
```

## 📝 Coding Conventions

- Use `long long` instead of `int` when numbers can exceed 10^9
- Use `vector` instead of arrays when size is variable
- Use fast I/O for large inputs
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Handle edge cases (empty inputs, single element, etc.)
